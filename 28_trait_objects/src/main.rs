/*
    In Chapter 8, we mentioned that one limitation of vectors is that they can store elements of only one type.
    We created a workaround in Listing 8-9 where we defined a SpreadsheetCell enum that had variants to hold integers,
    floats, and text. This meant we could store different types of data in each cell and still have a vector that
    represented a row of cells. This is a perfectly good solution when our interchangeable items are a fixed set of
    types that we know when our code is compiled.

    However, sometimes we want our library user to be able to extend the set of types that are valid in a
    particular situation. To show how we might achieve this, we’ll create an example graphical user
    interface (GUI) tool that iterates through a list of items, calling a draw method on each one to draw it to the
    screen—a common technique for GUI tools. We’ll create a library crate called gui that contains the
    structure of a GUI library. This crate might include some types for people to use, such as Button or TextField.
    In addition, gui users will want to create their own types that can be drawn: for instance, one programmer might add an
    Image and another might add a SelectBox.

    We won’t implement a fully fledged GUI library for this example but will show how the pieces would fit together.
    At the time of writing the library, we can’t know and define all the types other programmers might want to create.
    But we do know that gui needs to keep track of many values of different types, and it needs to call a
    draw method on each of these differently typed values. It doesn’t need to know exactly what will happen when we call the
    draw method, just that the value will have that method available for us to call.

    To do this in a language with inheritance, we might define a class named Component that has a method named draw on it.
    The other classes, such as Button, Image, and SelectBox, would inherit from Component and thus inherit the draw method.

    They could each override the draw method to define their custom behavior, but the framework could treat all of
    the types as if they were Component instances and call draw on them. But because Rust doesn’t have inheritance,
    we need another way to structure the gui library to allow users to extend it with new types.
